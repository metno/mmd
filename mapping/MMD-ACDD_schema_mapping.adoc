== Mapping between  MMD and ACDD (v1.3)

The mapping below is used as background information to create MMD records from datasets with ACDD discovery attributes. In addition, an extended list of attributes has been
created to support data publication through the Arctic Data Centre. The mapping below includes these attributes.
