[[activity-type]]
=== Activity Type

Controlled vocabulary to be used in METAMOD context to describe activity types. Rather than using the term observation type or platform which possibly could describe the nature of observed datasets, activity type is used to filter between both observations and simulations that possibly are describing the same phenomena. Activity types are used to identify the origin of the dataset documented within METAMOD. This is not an identification of the observation platform (e.g. specific vessel, SYNOP station or satellite), but more the nature of the generation process (e.g. simulation, in situ observation, remote sensing etc). It is useful in the context of filtering data when searching for relevant datasets.

[cols="2,8"]
|===
| code | definition

| Aircraft| Observations made during a flight trajectory. The observations can include remote sensing instruments, dropsondes or in situ measurements. Both manned and unmanned vehicles are covered by this term. The output is typically a trajectory, but could also be profiles or points.

| Space Borne Instrument| Observations or analysed products based upon data from a space borne instrument (typically onboard a satellite). The nature of the output is typically gridded of type imagery or profiles.

| Numerical Simulation| Data are generated by the use of a numerical simulation of the atmosphere, the ocean, the climate or similar. Statistical analysis is not covered by this.

| Climate Indicator| This indicates a dataset that has been generated by analysis of some data with the emphasis on being representative in a climate context (e.g. consistent in time). Furthermore, a climate indicator is "compact" representation of the feature studied (e.g. the temporal evolution of area covered by sea ice in the Arctic). Climate Indicators are frequently linked to GCOS requirements.

| In Situ Land-based station| This is used to tag datasets generated from a site located on land. This can be a permanent (e.g. a SYNOP or TEMP station) or a temporary site (e.g. a field experiment).

| In Situ Ship-based station| This is used to identify datasets generated during cruises. Typically it describes a full dataset generated in a context, possibly describing both ocean and atmospheric conditions.

| In Situ Ocean fixed station| This is used to describe ocean stations that are fixed in space. Typically this is moorings, anchored buoys, oil rigs etc.

| In Situ Ocean moving station| This is used to describe ocean stations that are moving around. Typically this is gliders and drifting buoys.

| In Situ Ice-based station| This is used to tag datasets generated from a site located on drifting sea ice or some other ice sheet (possibly on land but moving). It typically describes a temporary site (e.g. a field experiment). It would also be used to describe ships frozen in ice and drifting e.g. across the Arctic as well as Ice Thethered Platforms (ITP) and Ice Mass Balance Buoys (IMBB).

| Interview/Questionnaire| This is not much used within environmental science, but comes in useful sometimes. It is used to cover the results of interviews and questionnaires especially in interdisciplinary science.

| Maps/Charts/Photographs| This is used to tag datasets containing imagery or PDF documents. This could e.g. be a time lapse photographic session of a specific site illustrating e.g. snow cover or cloud cover. It can also be used to tag documents or maps describing the nature of a field station. It would then require datasets to be linked (which currently is not supported).

| Not available| This is used when information on the activity type is not available or not provided.

| TR-L1B-IR-SIR| Level 1B irradiance products from the TROPOMI instrument onboard Sentinel-5 Precursor, containing solar irradiance spectra. The instrument uses passive remote sensing techniques to attain its objective by measuring, at the Top Of Atmosphere (TOA), the solar radiation reflected by and radiated from Earth. There are four different spectrometers, each with its own optics and detector: mediumwave ultraviolet (UV), longwave ultraviolet combined with visible (UVIS), near infrared (NIR), and shortwave infrared (SWIR). The spectrometers for UV, UVIS and NIR are jointly referred to as UVN. Radiation for the SWIR spectrometer is transferred by an optical relay part in the UVN system from the telescope to an interface position (the pupil stop) for the SWIR spectrometer. This is done because of the more stringent thermal requirements on the SWIR part of the instrument. L1B_IR_SIR products contain the solar irradiance spectra for the SWIR bands (band 7 and band 8). This covers the spectral range of 2305-2385 nm.

| TR-L2-AER-AI| The TROPOMI instrument onboard Sentinel-5 Precursor is a nadir-viewing, imaging spectrometer covering wavelength bands between the ultraviolet and the shortwave infrared. The instrument uses passive remote sensing techniques to attain its objective by measuring, at the Top Of Atmosphere (TOA), the solar radiation reflected by and radiated from Earth. TROPOMI aerosol index is referred to as the Ultraviolet Aerosol Index (UVAI). The relatively simple calculation of the Aerosol Index is based on wavelength dependent changes in Rayleigh scattering in the UV spectral range where ozone absorption is very small. UVAI can also be calculated in the presence of clouds so that daily, global coverage is possible. This is ideal for tracking the evolution of episodic aerosol plumes from dust outbreaks, volcanic ash, and biomass burning.

| TR-L2-AER-LH| The TROPOMI Aerosol Layer Height product focuses on retrieval of vertically localised aerosol layers in the free troposphere, such as desert dust, biomass burning aerosol, or volcanic ash plumes. The height of such layers is retrieved for cloud-free conditions.

The TROPOMI instrument, single payload onboard Sentinel-5 Precursor, retrieves operationally the most important quantities for cloud correction of satellite trace gas retrievals: cloud fraction, cloud optical thickness (albedo), and cloud-top pressure (height). Cloud parameters from TROPOMI are not only used for enhancing the accuracy of trace gas retrievals, but also to extend the satellite data record of cloud information derived from oxygen A-band measurements initiated with GOME.

The TROPOMI instrument, single payload onboard Sentinel-5 Precursor, retrieves the CO global abundance exploiting clear-sky and cloudy-sky Earth radiance measurements in the 2.3 �m spectral range of the shortwave infrared (SWIR) part of the solar spectrum. TROPOMI clear sky observations provide CO total columns with sensitivity to the tropospheric boundary layer. For cloudy atmospheres, the column sensitivity changes according to the light path.

The instrument uses passive remote sensing techniques to attain its objective by measuring, at the Top Of Atmosphere (TOA), the solar radiation reflected by and radiated from the earth. Ozone (O3) is of crucial importance for the equilibrium of the Earth's atmosphere. In the stratosphere, the ozone layer shields the biosphere from dangerous solar ultraviolet radiation. In the troposphere, it acts as an efficient cleansing agent, but at high concentration it also becomes harmful to the health of humans, animals, and vegetation. Ozone is also an important greenhouse-gas contributor to ongoing climate change.

| TR-L2-O3-TCL| The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) tropospheric ozone product is a level-2c product that represents three days of averaged tropospheric ozone columns on a 0.5° by 1° latitude-longitude grid for the tropical region between 20°N and 20°S.

The instrument uses passive remote sensing techniques to attain its objective by measuring, at the Top Of Atmosphere (TOA), the solar radiation reflected by and radiated from the earth. The S5P level 2 methane product is dependent on having information on cloud occurrence at spatial resolution finer than that achievable from TROPOMI itself. This information is also useful for other purposes, including assessing the influence of cloud on other L2 products and issues related to spatial co-registration. A level 2 auxiliary product was therefore developed to describe cloud in the TROPOMI field of view (FOV), using co-located observations of VIIRS (Visible Infra-red Imaging Radiometer Suite) on the U.S. S-NPP (Suomi - National Polar-orbiting Partnership). S5P flies in a so-called loose formation with the S-NPP with a temporal separation between them of less than 5 minutes. The main information contained in the S5P-NPP product is: A statistical summary for each S5P FOV of the NPP-VIIRS L2 Cloud Mask (VCM). The mean and standard deviation of the sun-normalised radiance in a number of VIIRS moderate resolution bands. This information is provided for three S5P spectral bands (to account for differences in spatial sampling).
