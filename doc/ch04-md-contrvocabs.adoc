=== Operational status

[cols="2,8"]
|=======================================================================
|Code |Description

|Operational |This is used to tag datasets that are continously being
evaluated and validated. The production of the data is under the
responsibility of an authority and follows a review and documentation
process. Operational data are generated on a continuous basis with a
temporal perspective.

|Pre-Operational |This is used to describe data that are under review
for becoming the next operational delivery. It is usually produced
continuously, but not necessarily distributed to users not specifically.
It covers the intermediate step between Experimental and Operational.

|Experimental |This is used to describe data that belongs to a
development and production chain that provides operational data. It is
the first step in the process of becoming operational.

|Scientific |This is used to describe purely scientific products. That
is products generated through scientific projects and usually with a
limited temporal perspective.

|Not available | This is used when information on the operational status 
is not available or not provided.

[[activity-type]]
=== Activity type

Controlled vocabulary used to describe activity types. Rather than using
the term observation type or platform which possibly could describe the
nature of observed datasets, activity type is used to filter between
both observations and simulations that possibly are describing the same
phenomena. Activity types are used to identify the origin of the dataset
documented within METAMOD. This is not an identification of the
observation platform (e.g. specific vessel, SYNOP station or satellite),
but more the nature of the generation process (e.g. simulation, in situ
observation, remote sensing etc). It is useful in the context of
filtering data when searching for relevant datasets.

[cols="3,7"]
|=======================================================================
|Code |Description

|Aircraft |Observations made during a flight trajectory. The
observations caninclude remote sensing instruments, dropsondes or in
situ measurements.Both manned and unmanned vehicles are covered by this
term. The outputis typically a trajectory, but could also be profiles or
points.

|Space Borne Instrument |Observations or analysed products based upon
data from a space borneinstrument (typically onboard a satellite). The
nature of the output is typically gridded of type imagery or profiles.

|Numerical Simulation |Data are generated by the use of a numerical
simulation of theatmosphere, the ocean, the climate or similar.
Statistical analysis is not covered by this.

|Climate Indicator |This indicates a dataset that has been generated by
analysis of somedata with the emphasis on being representative in a
climate context (e.g. consistent in time). Furthermore, a climate
indicator is a "compact" representation of the feature studied (e.g. the
temporal evolution of area covered by sea ice in the Arctic). Climate
Indicatorsare frequently linked to GCOS requirements.

|In Situ Land-based station(Land station) (Field Experiment) |This is
used to tag datasets generated from a site located on land. Thiscan be a
permanent (e.g. a SYNOP or TEMP station) or a temporary site (e.g. a
field experiment).

|In Situ Ship-based station(Cruise) |This is used to identify datasets
generated during cruises. Typically it describes a full dataset
generated in a context, possibly describing both ocean and atmospheric
conditions.

|In Situ Ocean fixed station(Moored instrument) |This is used to
describe ocean stations that are fixed in space.Typically this is
moorings, anchored buoys, oil rigs etc.

|In Situ Ocean moving station(Float) |This is used to describe ocean
stations that are moving around.Typically this is gliders and drifting
buoys.

|In Situ Ice-based station(Ice station) (Field Experiment) |This is used
to tag datasets generated from a site located on driftingsea ice or some
other ice sheet (possibly on land but moving). It typically describes a
temporary site (e.g. a field experiment). It would also be used to
describe ships frozen in ice and drifting e.g. across the Arctic as well
as Ice Thethered Platforms (ITP) and Ice Mass BalanceBuoys (IMBB).

|Interview/Questionnaire(Interview) (Questionnaire) |This is not much
used within environmental science, but comes in usefulsometimes. It is
used to cover the results of interviews and questionnaires especially in
interdisciplinary science.

|Maps/Charts/Photographs(Maps) (Charts)(Photographs) |This is used to
tag datasets containing imagery or PDF documents. Thiscould e.g. be a
time lapse photographic session of a specific site illustrating e.g.
snow cover or cloud cover. It can also be used to tagdocuments or maps
describing the nature of a field station. It would then require datasets
to be linked (which currently is not supported).

|Not available | This is used when information on the activity type is not 
available or not provided.

[[variable-parameter-descriptions]]
=== Variable/parameter descriptions

For description of parameters MMD is currently relying on GCMD Science
Keywords. The GCMD Science Keywords are available in multiple forms.

GCMD Science Keywords

 . https://gcmd.earthdata.nasa.gov/kms/concepts/concept_scheme/sciencekeywords/?format=json JSON
 . https://gcmd.earthdata.nasa.gov/kms/concepts/concept_scheme/sciencekeywords/?format=rdf RDF
 . https://gcmd.earthdata.nasa.gov/kms/capabilities?format=html API

However many datasets are encoded using the
http://cfconventions.org[Climate and Forecast convention]. In this CF
Standard Names are used. These are available through
http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html and can be converted to GCMD Science Keywords using
http://dap.onc.uvic.ca/erddap/convert/keywords.html (further information
to be provided).

For observational data WMO Integrated Global Observing System (WIGOS)
observed parameter descriptions can be used. These are available at
https://codes.wmo.int/wmdr/. Use information from the sections on observed
variable.

|TR-L1B-IR-SIR |Infrared Sounder Level-1B Shortwave Infrared|Level 1B irradiance products from the TROPOMI instrument onboard Sentinel-5 Precursor, containing solar irradiance spectra. The instrument uses passive remote sensing techniques to attain its objective by measuring, at the Top Of Atmosphere (TOA), the solar radiation reflected by and radiated from Earth. There are four different spectrometers, each with its own optics and detector: mediumwave ultraviolet (UV), longwave ultraviolet combined with visible (UVIS), near infrared (NIR), and shortwave infrared (SWIR). The spectrometers for UV, UVIS and NIR are jointly referred to as UVN. Radiation for the SWIR spectrometer is transferred by an optical relay part in the UVN system from the telescope to an interface position (the pupil stop) for the SWIR spectrometer. This is done because of the more stringent thermal requirements on the SWIR part of the instrument. L1B_IR_SIR products contain the solar irradiance spectra for the SWIR bands (band 7 and band 8). This covers the spectral range of 2305-2385 nm.

|TR-L1B-IR-UVN |Infrared Sounder Level-1B Ultraviolet-Visible-Near Infrared|Level 1B irradiance products from the TROPOMI instrument onboard Sentinel-5 Precursor, containing solar irradiance spectra.

|TR-L2-AER-AI |Level-2 Aerosol Index|The TROPOMI instrument onboard Sentinel-5 Precursor is a nadir-viewing, imaging spectrometer covering wavelength bands between the ultraviolet and the shortwave infrared. The instrument uses passive remote sensing techniques to attain its objective by measuring, at the Top Of Atmosphere (TOA), the solar radiation reflected by and radiated from Earth. TROPOMI aerosol index is referred to as the Ultraviolet Aerosol Index (UVAI). The relatively simple calculation of the Aerosol Index is based on wavelength dependent changes in Rayleigh scattering in the UV spectral range where ozone absorption is very small. UVAI can also be calculated in the presence of clouds so that daily, global coverage is possible. This is ideal for tracking the evolution of episodic aerosol plumes from dust outbreaks, volcanic ash, and biomass burning.

|TR-L2-AER-LH |Level-2 Layer Height (mid-level pressure)|The TROPOMI Aerosol Layer Height product focuses on retrieval of vertically localised aerosol layers in the free troposphere, such as desert dust, biomass burning aerosol, or volcanic ash plumes. The height of such layers is retrieved for cloud-free conditions.

|TR-L2-CLOUD |Level-2 Cloud Properties|The TROPOMI instrument onboard Sentinel-5 Precursor is a nadir-viewing, imaging spectrometer covering wavelength bands between the ultraviolet and the shortwave infrared. The instrument uses passive remote sensing techniques to attain its objective by measuring, at the Top Of Atmosphere (TOA), the solar radiation reflected by and radiated from the earth. The TROPOMI instrument, single payload onboard Sentinel-5 Precursor, retrieves operationally the most important quantities for cloud correction of satellite trace gas retrievals: cloud fraction, cloud optical thickness (albedo), and cloud-top pressure (height). Cloud parameters from TROPOMI are not only used for enhancing the accuracy of trace gas retrievals, but also to extend the satellite data record of cloud information derived from oxygen A-band measurements initiated with GOME.

|TR-L2-CO |Level-2 Carbon Monoxide total column|The TROPOMI instrument onboard Sentinel-5 Precursor is a nadir-viewing, imaging spectrometer covering wavelength bands between the ultraviolet and the shortwave infrared. The instrument uses passive remote sensing techniques to attain its objective by measuring, at the Top Of Atmosphere (TOA), the solar radiation reflected by and radiated from Earth. The TROPOMI instrument, single payload onboard Sentinel-5 Precursor, retrieves the CO global abundance exploiting clear-sky and cloudy-sky Earth radiance measurements in the 2.3 �m spectral range of the shortwave infrared (SWIR) part of the solar spectrum. TROPOMI clear sky observations provide CO total columns with sensitivity to the tropospheric boundary layer. For cloudy atmospheres, the column sensitivity changes according to the light path. The TROPOMI CO retrieval uses the same method employed by SCIAMACHY.

|TR-L2-NO2 |Level-2 Nitrogen Dioxide total column|The TROPOMI instrument onboard Sentinel-5 Precursor is a nadir-viewing, imaging spectrometer covering wavelength bands between the ultraviolet and the shortwave infrared. The instrument uses passive remote sensing techniques to attain its objective by measuring, at the Top Of Atmosphere (TOA), the solar radiation reflected by and radiated from Earth. The TROPOMI instrument, single payload onboard Sentinel-5 Precursor, retrieves operationally tropospheric and stratospheric NO2 column products. The TROPOMI NO2 data products pose an improvement over previous NO2 data sets, particularly in their unprecedented spatial resolution, but also in the separation of the stratospheric and tropospheric contributions of the retrieved slant columns, and in the calculation of the air-mass factors used to convert slant to total columns.

|TR-L2-SO2 |Level-2 Sulphor Dioxide total column|Total column Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) data from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) aboard the Sentinel 5P satellite.

|TR-L2-CH4 |Level-2 Methane total column|Level 2 (geolocated) total column Methane (CH4) data from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) aboard the Sentinel 5P satellite.

|TR-L2-HCHO |Level-2 Formaldehyde total column|Total column Formaldehyde (HCHO) data from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) aboard the Sentinel 5P satellite.

|TR-L2-O3 |Level-2 Ozone total column|The TROPOMI instrument onboard Sentinel-5 Precursor is a nadir-viewing, imaging spectrometer covering wavelength bands between the ultraviolet and the shortwave infrared. The instrument uses passive remote sensing techniques to attain its objective by measuring, at the Top Of Atmosphere (TOA), the solar radiation reflected by and radiated from the earth. Ozone (O3) is of crucial importance for the equilibrium of the Earth's atmosphere. In the stratosphere, the ozone layer shields the biosphere from dangerous solar ultraviolet radiation. In the troposphere, it acts as an efficient cleansing agent, but at high concentration it also becomes harmful to the health of humans, animals, and vegetation. Ozone is also an important greenhouse-gas contributor to ongoing climate change.

|TR-L2-O3-TCL |Level-2 Ozone tropospheric column|The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) tropospheric ozone product is a level-2c product that represents three days of averaged tropospheric ozone columns on a 0.5� by 1� latitude-longitude grid for the tropical region between 20�N and 20�S. The TROPOMI tropospheric ozone column product uses the TROPOMI Level-2 total OZONE and CLOUD products as input.

|TR-L2-O3-PR |Level-2 Ozone profile|Sentinel 5P total column ozone products contain total ozone, ozone temperature, and error information including averaging kernels. These data products are provided in a 7km x 3.5km resolution.

|TR-L2-NP-BD3 |Level-2 Neural Network Probability Product Band 3|The TROPOMI instrument onboard Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) is a nadir-viewing, imaging spectrometer covering wavelength bands between the ultraviolet and the shortwave infrared. The instrument uses passive remote sensing techniques to attain its objective by measuring, at the Top Of Atmosphere (TOA), the solar radiation reflected by and radiated from the earth. The S5P level 2 methane product is dependent on having information on cloud occurrence at spatial resolution finer than that achievable from TROPOMI itself. This information is also useful for other purposes, including assessing the influence of cloud on other L2 products and issues related to spatial co-registration. A level 2 auxiliary product was therefore developed to describe cloud in the TROPOMI field of view (FOV), using co-located observations of VIIRS (Visible Infra-red Imaging Radiometer Suite) on the U.S. S-NPP (Suomi - National Polar-orbiting Partnership). S5P flies in a so-called loose formation with the S-NPP with a temporal separation between them of less than 5 minutes. The main information contained in the S5P-NPP product is: A statistical summary for each S5P FOV of the NPP-VIIRS L2 Cloud Mask (VCM). The mean and standard deviation of the sun-normalised radiance in a number of VIIRS moderate resolution bands. This information is provided for three S5P spectral bands (to account for differences in spatial sampling).
