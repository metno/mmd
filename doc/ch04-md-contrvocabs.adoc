|Code |Description

|Operational |This is used to tag datasets that are continously being
evaluated and validated. The production of the data is under the
responsibility of an authority and follows a review and documentation
process. Operational data are generated on a continuous basis with a
temporal perspective.

|Pre-Operational |This is used to describe data that are under review
for becoming the next operational delivery. It is usually produced
continuously, but not necessarily distributed to users not specifically.
It covers the intermediate step between Experimental and Operational.

|Experimental |This is used to describe data that belongs to a
development and production chain that provides operational data. It is
the first step in the process of becoming operational.

|Scientific |This is used to describe purely scientific products. That
is products generated through scientific projects and usually with a
limited temporal perspective.

|Not available | This is used when information on the operational status 
is not available or not provided.

[[activity-type]]
=== Activity type

Controlled vocabulary used to describe activity types. Rather than using
the term observation type or platform which possibly could describe the
nature of observed datasets, activity type is used to filter between
both observations and simulations that possibly are describing the same
phenomena. Activity types are used to identify the origin of the dataset
documented within METAMOD. This is not an identification of the
observation platform (e.g. specific vessel, SYNOP station or satellite),
but more the nature of the generation process (e.g. simulation, in situ
observation, remote sensing etc). It is useful in the context of
filtering data when searching for relevant datasets.

[cols="3,7"]
|=======================================================================
|Code |Description

|Aircraft |Observations made during a flight trajectory. The
observations caninclude remote sensing instruments, dropsondes or in
situ measurements.Both manned and unmanned vehicles are covered by this
term. The outputis typically a trajectory, but could also be profiles or
points.

|Space Borne Instrument |Observations or analysed products based upon
data from a space borneinstrument (typically onboard a satellite). The
nature of the output is typically gridded of type imagery or profiles.

|Numerical Simulation |Data are generated by the use of a numerical
simulation of theatmosphere, the ocean, the climate or similar.
Statistical analysis is not covered by this.

|Climate Indicator |This indicates a dataset that has been generated by
analysis of somedata with the emphasis on being representative in a
climate context (e.g. consistent in time). Furthermore, a climate
indicator is a "compact" representation of the feature studied (e.g. the
temporal evolution of area covered by sea ice in the Arctic). Climate
Indicatorsare frequently linked to GCOS requirements.

|In Situ Land-based station(Land station) (Field Experiment) |This is
used to tag datasets generated from a site located on land. Thiscan be a
permanent (e.g. a SYNOP or TEMP station) or a temporary site (e.g. a
field experiment).

|In Situ Ship-based station(Cruise) |This is used to identify datasets
generated during cruises. Typically it describes a full dataset
generated in a context, possibly describing both ocean and atmospheric
conditions.

|In Situ Ocean fixed station(Moored instrument) |This is used to
describe ocean stations that are fixed in space.Typically this is
moorings, anchored buoys, oil rigs etc.

|In Situ Ocean moving station(Float) |This is used to describe ocean
stations that are moving around.Typically this is gliders and drifting
buoys.

|In Situ Ice-based station(Ice station) (Field Experiment) |This is used
to tag datasets generated from a site located on driftingsea ice or some
other ice sheet (possibly on land but moving). It typically describes a
temporary site (e.g. a field experiment). It would also be used to
describe ships frozen in ice and drifting e.g. across the Arctic as well
as Ice Thethered Platforms (ITP) and Ice Mass BalanceBuoys (IMBB).

|Interview/Questionnaire(Interview) (Questionnaire) |This is not much
used within environmental science, but comes in usefulsometimes. It is
used to cover the results of interviews and questionnaires especially in
interdisciplinary science.

|Maps/Charts/Photographs(Maps) (Charts)(Photographs) |This is used to
tag datasets containing imagery or PDF documents. Thiscould e.g. be a
time lapse photographic session of a specific site illustrating e.g.
snow cover or cloud cover. It can also be used to tagdocuments or maps
describing the nature of a field station. It would then require datasets
to be linked (which currently is not supported).

|Not available | This is used when information on the activity type is not 
available or not provided.

[[variable-parameter-descriptions]]
=== Variable/parameter descriptions

For description of parameters MMD is currently relying on GCMD Science
Keywords. The GCMD Science Keywords are available in multiple forms.

However many datasets are encoded using the
http://cfconventions.org[Climate and Forecast convention]. In this CF
Standard Names are used. These are available through
http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html and can be converted to GCMD Science Keywords using
http://dap.onc.uvic.ca/erddap/convert/keywords.html (further information

For observational data WMO Integrated Global Observing System (WIGOS)
