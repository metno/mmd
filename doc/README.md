## Documentation

This folder contains the documentation in AsciiDoc for the MMD specifications. The html and pdf are automatically
generated by GitHub actions and should not be modified.

The ch04-md-contrvocabs.adoc, including all valid terms for the controlled vocabularies, is generated using the script
in ../xsd/create_enum.py. The ch04-md-contrvocabs.adoc must not be edited, as it will be overwritten when the script
is run.
