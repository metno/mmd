|Description a|
The platform used to collect the data. The element is described using
the following child elements:

short_name:: 
is the abbreviated name of the platform (see <<platform-1>>) used to
acquire the data 
long_name:: 
is the full name of the platform (see <<platform-1>>) used
to acquire the data.
resource::
is a link to further information about the satellite. For this purpose
descriptions from https://www.wmo-sat.info/oscar/satellites are used (see <<platform-1>>)
orbit_relative::
is the relative orbit number for a polar orbiting satellite.
orbit_absolute::
is the absolute orbit number for a polar orbiting satellite.
orbit_direction::
is either "ascending" or "descending" and defines the orbit direction of
polar orbiting satellites.
instrument::
is a specification of the instrument. This used to be a separate element,
but has been incorporated in the platform element to have a more compact
information model. This element has several children. Similar to for
platform, one of the child elements are *resource* and for this purpose
also the WIGOS list https://www.wmo-sat.info/oscar/instruments is used.
This element was originally used to store information for NBS products (Sentinel
platforms), but covers a need for a wider range of use cases, including
internal MET use cases that has been long needed. 
* short_name is an acronym for the sensor, see <<instruments>>
* long_name is the full name, see <<instruments>>
* resource is a link to further information in WIGOS space, see <<instruments>>
* mode is specific for SAR (can be for other instruments in the future), +
see <<instrument-modes>>.
* polarisation is also for SAR, see <<polarisation-modes>>
* product_type is for the Sentinel satellites, see <<product-type>> for +
more information.

ancillary::
is used for information that does not fit in any of the other elements. It
includes:
* cloud_coverage in percentage which indicates how much of the available +
data that are covered by clouds. This is used for optical satellite data.
* scene_coverage in percentage which indicates how much of map projected +
satellite product that actually is covered by the satellite. This is
useful for e.g. Sentinel-2 data and old AVHRR data at MET.
* timeliness indicates whether the data are delayed or Near Real Time +
(NRT) data.

See <<platform-1,platform>> for list of satellite names. The intention is
to move towards WIGOS space vocabularies once these become available in
machine readable form through SKOS files or https://codes.wmo.int/wmdr.
