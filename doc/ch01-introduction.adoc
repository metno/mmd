== Introduction

MET Norway Metadata Format (MMD) is an XML metadata format for storing
information about scientific datasets. It is meant for consumption by
internal systems and to be a corner stone in our data management. The main
focus of MMD is to ensure that all relevant datasets managed by MET Norway
are findable. As such the specification is strongly linked to discovery
metadata standards like ISO19115 and GCMD DIF, but it also extends these
as it contains configuration metadata specific for the handling of the
datasets at the host data centre.

[[scope]]
=== Scope

The intended audience of this document is MET Norway employees
responsible for 

* implementing and maintaining software for metadata management in support
  of internal and external services
* managing datasets
* contributing to external distributed data management services

The following national and international data management activities have
been or are supported using the MMD specification and related software
components:

* https://www.barentswatch.no[BarentsWatch]
* Halo
* https://www.geonorge.no/Geodataarbeid/Norge-digitalt/[Norge digitalt]

The purpose is to document datasets, not web services. Information in on
the web services for a datasets is provided through the data_access
element and accompanied by e.g. GetCapabilities documents.

Development of the specification have been supported through research
grants from the Research Council of Norway, Norwegian Space Agency,
European Space Agency, EUMETSAT, EU and ministries (BarentsWatch and
S-ENDA).

[[objectives]]
=== Objectives

. To document data and products managed by MET Norway.
. To facilitate metadata re-use between different projects and
services at MET Norway.
. To be compatible with the GCMD DIF and ISO19115/ISO19139 metadata
standards as imposed by WMO and Norge Digitalt/INSPIRE.
. To provide as lossless conversion between the different formats as
possible.
